### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I learned how to use Flexbox mainly. The code below shows how i use Flexbox to center a one element.

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Image">
</div>
```
```css
.card {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want learn how to make the code more clean. I already know how to use HTML and CSS, but i need to learn more about semantic of HTML and the use of CSS more effectively.
